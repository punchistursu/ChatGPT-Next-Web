You can also follow the developer on Twitter (@JannikNickel) or join the Discord server (https://discord.gg/ancientwarfare) to stay updated on the game's progress and interact with other players. Ancient Warfare 3 Alpha 22 is a game that offers endless possibilities for creating and playing your own battles. Whether you want to fight zombies with snowballs, conquer ancient kingdoms with futuristic weapons, or just have fun with your own imagination, Ancient Warfare 3 Alpha 22 is a game worth trying.

So, how does Ancient Warfare 3 Alpha 22 play? Well, the game is very easy to get into and offers a lot of freedom and creativity. You can start by choosing one of the many game modes or create your own with the custom battle editor. You can then select the biome, environment, objects, units, weapons, and settings for your scenario. You can also use the unit creator to make your own custom units with different appearance and equipment. You can even use the scripting system to add logic and events to your scenarios. The game also supports Steam Workshop integration, so you can download and upload your creations with other players.
 
The gameplay itself is very fun and chaotic. You can control your units directly or let them fight on their own. You can switch between first-person, third-person, and top-down views. You can also use different weapons and items to fight your enemies or support your allies. The game features a variety of content from different eras, such as swords, spears, bows, guns, rockets, tanks, helicopters, zombies, aliens, and more. The game also has a physics system that allows for realistic destruction and ragdoll effects. The game is not very realistic or balanced, but that's part of its charm and humor.
 
However, the game is not without its flaws. As an Early Access game, Ancient Warfare 3 Alpha 22 still has some bugs and glitches that can affect the gameplay. Some examples are units getting stuck in objects, weapons not working properly, animations being weird, and performance issues. The game also lacks some features that could improve the experience, such as multiplayer mode, tutorial mode, sound effects, music, and more polish. The developer is aware of these issues and plans to fix them in future updates based on community feedback[^1^]. The game also has a Discord server where you can report bugs and suggest ideas.
