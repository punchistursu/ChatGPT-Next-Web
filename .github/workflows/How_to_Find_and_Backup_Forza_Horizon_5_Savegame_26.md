## How to Earn Skill Points in Forza Horizon 5?
 
Skill Points are a valuable currency in Forza Horizon 5 that you can use to unlock perks for your cars. Perks can give you benefits such as increased speed skills, improved skill multipliers, and even wheelspins[^2^]. But how do you earn Skill Points in the first place?
 
The answer is simple: by performing skills. Skills are any actions that you do while driving that show off your style and technique, such as drifting, smashing through fences, and getting air time[^1^]. The more skills you perform in a row, the higher your skill chain score will be. However, if you crash or stop moving for too long, your skill chain will end and you will lose all your points.
 
To avoid losing your points, you need to bank them before they disappear. You can do this by either waiting for a few seconds until the game automatically banks them for you, or by pressing the X button on your controller to manually bank them. Once you bank your points, they will be added to your Skill Point total, which you can see on the top left corner of your screen.
 
To accumulate Skill Points faster, you can try to perform different types of skills in a single chain, as this will increase your multiplier. You can also look for areas that have a lot of objects to smash or ramps to jump off, such as the open desert or the jungle. Additionally, you can use cars that have perks that boost your skill score or multiplier, such as the Ford F-150 Raptor '17 or the Lamborghini Huracan Performante '18[^2^].
 
## How to Find Barn Finds in Forza Horizon 5?
 
Barn Finds are one of the most rewarding activities in Forza Horizon 5. They are hidden locations where you can find classic cars that have been abandoned and forgotten. There are 14 Barn Finds in total, each with a unique car that you can restore and add to your collection[^3^]. But how do you find them?
 
The first step is to unlock them by progressing through the Horizon Adventure campaign. As you earn Accolade Points by completing races and other activities, you will eventually receive a call from Jamin, who will give you a hint about a Barn Find location. You can also unlock more Barn Finds by purchasing certain properties on the map.
 
Once you unlock a Barn Find, it will appear as a large circle on your map. This circle represents the general area where the barn is located, but not the exact spot. To find the barn, you need to explore the circle and look for clues such as tire tracks, fences, or buildings. However, driving around can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially if the circle is large or has a lot of terrain features.
 
A better way to find Barn Finds is to use your drone[^3^]. The drone is a handy tool that lets you fly around and scout the area without having to drive. You can access the drone by pressing down on the D-pad and selecting it from the menu. Then, you can use the left stick to move around and the right stick to adjust the camera angle. The drone has a much better view than your car and can spot things that you might miss while driving.
 
When you find the barn with your drone, it will mark it on your map for you to drive to. Then, all you have to do is approach the barn and press X to reveal the car inside. Jamin will then take it to his garage and restore it for you. You can check on his progress by visiting his garage on the map or by calling him from the menu. Once he's done, you can claim your car and enjoy your new ride.
