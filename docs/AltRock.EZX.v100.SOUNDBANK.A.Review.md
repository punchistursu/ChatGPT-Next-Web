What makes this soundbank stand out is the sonic fingerprint of Steve Albini, who used his unique method of mic placement, attention to detail, and drum tuning scrutiny to create a crude, genuine, and raw palette of drum sounds with an incredible range[^1^]. The soundbank also captures the ambience of his very own studio, Electrical Audio in Chicago, IL, which he personally built and designed[^1^].
 
The Alt-Rock EZX v1.0.0 (SOUNDBANK) is perfect for the soft-loud-soft approach that is synonymous with the distinct dynamics of the classic alt-rock sound. You can use it to create songs that span from mellow and melodic to aggressive and distorted. The soundbank is compatible with software emulations of guitar amplifiers and stomp boxes, and it offers 35 presets divided into six banks: Kicks, Snare, Trumpet, Harp, Bass, and Guitars[^2^]. Each preset has multiple variations and gives you access to the crucial sound parameters that were used to craft it[^2^].
 
If you are a fan of alternative rock or want to add some edge and grit to your drum tracks, you should definitely give the Alt-Rock EZX v1.0.0 (SOUNDBANK) a try. It is available for download at Toontrack's website for $89 USD[^1^]. You can also listen to some samples of the soundbank on Soundcloud[^2^].
  
In this section, we will take a closer look at the two drum kits and the cymbal setups that are included in the Alt-Rock EZX v1.0.0 (SOUNDBANK). The first kit is a Ludwig Club Date from the late 1960s, which has a warm and vintage sound. The kit consists of a 20" kick, a 14" snare, and 12" and 14" toms. The cymbals are a mix of Zildjian A and K series, as well as a Paiste 2002 crash. The second kit is a DW Collector's Series from the early 2000s, which has a modern and punchy sound. The kit consists of a 22" kick, a 14" snare, and 10", 12", and 16" toms. The cymbals are a mix of Zildjian A Custom and K Custom series, as well as a Sabian HHX crash.
 
Both kits were recorded with multiple microphones to capture the different nuances and tones of the drums. Steve Albini used his signature technique of placing microphones close to the drums, as well as in the room and in the hallways of his studio. He also used various preamps, compressors, and equalizers to shape the sound of the drums. The result is a rich and dynamic sound that can be tweaked and mixed to your liking.
 
The Alt-Rock EZX v1.0.0 (SOUNDBANK) also offers five additional snares that can be used to replace or layer with the main snare of each kit. These snares are: a Ludwig Acrolite from the 1970s, a Ludwig Black Beauty from the 1920s, a Ludwig Supraphonic from the 1960s, a Slingerland Radio King from the 1940s, and a Tama Bell Brass from the 1980s. Each snare has its own character and tone, ranging from bright and crisp to dark and fat. You can also choose from two additional kicks: a Ludwig Vistalite from the 1970s and a Gretsch USA Custom from the 1990s. These kicks have different sizes and tunings than the main kicks of each kit, giving you more options for your low end.
 
Finally, the Alt-Rock EZX v1.0.0 (SOUNDBANK) features five additional cymbals that can be used to complement or replace the main cymbals of each kit. These cymbals are: a Zildjian Avedis ride from the 1950s, a Zildjian K Constantinople ride from the 1960s, a Zildjian K Custom Dark ride from the 2000s, a Zildjian A Custom EFX crash from the 2000s, and a Zildjian Oriental China Trash from the 2000s. These cymbals add more variety and flavor to your cymbal sounds, from smooth and shimmering to trashy and explosive.
